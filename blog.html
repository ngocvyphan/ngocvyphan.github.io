        <b>When Canadians tell us about Vietnamese people</b>
    </li>
    
    <p></p>

    <li>Before reading what I am going to tell you from my CEO class, just put on a headphone and listen to this song.
        And
        how do you feel about this song? Is it cool, isn’t it? That was how the guest speakers in my class today ended
        the
        presentation of telling their trip to Vietnam, which made me so touched and homesick. How they can depict
        rightly
        the picture of Vietnamese life, how they can understand the culture in each places they have been through, how
        they
        can clearly state the differences between their country and Vietnam are something that made me feel impressive
        and
        admired to these two teachers (also a married couple teacher).
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>Before beginning the classes, when everyone was holding the phone including me, the teacher said: “Put the phone
        down and listen to our stories. I’m sure it will not make you disappointed.” He told so firmly and determinedly
        that I murmured to myself, “Alright, let’s put the phone back into the pocket and see what interesting things
        the teacher is going to show us.” And I still believed that nothing could make me get out of this boredom.
        (because the previous class- Canadian History also had guest speaker today so continuing to listen to the second
        guest speaker just made me feel bore.) But as soon as he began to introduce the topic today, I was really
        surprised and shocked. He was going to tell about Vietnam. And I was like: “I just left Vietnam for 2 months and
        now I am listening to Canadian talking about Vietnam. Oh! It’s cool. Just begin. I want your perspective and
        opinion about Vietnam”.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>And the wife and husband took turn to start slide-showing each picture on the board with the stories in each
        one. Each picture emerged, each speech came out, I was totally stun. The more they told, the more I admired
        those two people. They told exactly everything in Vietnam: how the house in Vietnam is built, how people
        transit, how people farm, how people go to buy food, … The husband and wife told a lot of stories, two of which
        made me laugh so hard. The first one is: “And this woman is like bringing all the business with her. I don’t
        know what’s inside of it, maybe it’s “pho”. (He showed the picture of a woman who is on a motorcycle and carries
        handcart attached to the motorcycle). The second one is when he told the transportation in Vietnam: “Can you
        imagine that we were on the bus and it was red light so we stopped. When we stopped, all the motorcycles go
        everywhere around the bus. Then the walker just pass the street. And the interesting here is the walker just go
        and all the motorcycle dodge them. And if the walker stops, they will be blaming and shouting on the walker:”Hey
        why you are stopping at the middle of road” The two stories made me laugh so hard, even till now.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>After the class, we- Vietnamese students met the wife and husband. And I could see their admiration in how
        friendly and warm-hearted the Vietnamese people are. And the husband and wife really loved the food in Vietnam:
        they love pho, which they are still searching for Vietnamese court at here, they love fruit: dragonfly, banana,
        especially durian, which they told it was really good, they love springrolls too and fish sauce. That’s how I am
        in love with this country, with these people in here. How they think of people first before thinking of
        themselves, how they want to help people with all their hearts. The husband has said: “There is no such a place
        as Vietnam that make you want to come back because of their friendliness and hospitality” And the wife has said:
        “And the quote I think fully describe my feeling after the trip is “You get a strangle feeling when you’re about
        to leave a place. Like you’ll not only miss the people you love but you’ll miss the person you are at now at
        this time and this place, because you’ll never be this way ever again.”
