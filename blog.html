            What I do on my holiday break after finishing four courses from my fall 2024 term?
            I chose a random movie to watch. I suddenly thought of the film: The Notting Hill and watched the entire
            film. I
            both felt likable and unlikable of the film. I will share which scenes make me unlike the film and which
            scenes
            make me like the film. I will also share some of my knowledge for the main actor and actress in the film:
            Hugh
            Grant and Julia Roberts. But first, let me take you to the plot of the film. And at the end of my review for
            the
            film, I will also share my rating for the film.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            The film revolves around a British bookstore owner whose name is William Thacker (starred by Hugh Grant) who
            is
            deeply in love with a star- Anna Scott (starred by Julia Roberts).
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Everyday will be the same for the bookstore owner, who also sells book everyday at his bookstore if Anna
            Scott
            hasn’t stepped in his bookstore. They start the conversation together when he tries to help her the book she
            wants to buy. If you are watching the film, you can tell that William is very interested in Anna as he still
            looked at the door where Anna left, after buying books. After this scene, we will put a question: What will
            happen next? How can they meet again?
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            But not wanting the audience to wait long, the director has let them meet together again when William bought
            a
            cup of orange juice and accidentally, ran into Anna again, spilling orange juice on her. Then William
            invited
            Anna to come to his flat, which is nearby, and after she changed clothes, they said goodbye together. But
            before
            Anna left, Anna kissed William.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            After that, William asked Spike- who lives in the same flat with William a lot if he received any calls and
            when
            Spike admitted that he remembered there was one call that William is looking for, William tried to call the
            number and was told to come to the Ritz hotel where Anna would be there. He had to pretend that he was
            someone
            else to talk with Anna and under the supervision of the people around her, he asked her if she was free
            tonight,
            unfortunately, Anna said she was busy. Leaving the room with an empty heart, William still had to go through
            a
            lot of talking with actresses, actors, and directors who also took part with Anna in the film. But finally,
            when
            he thought he would go back home not achieving anything, he finally got called again, telling him that he
            had a
            last final room to interview. William, unexpected that the final room would be Anna one more time, went to
            the
            room tirelessly but the tiresome soon be disappeared when he saw Anna again. She said to William she was
            free
            tonight.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Then the party at William’s sister- Honey was organized with the presence of Anna and William. Everyone was
            having a good time. It seems like the movie at the moment is all full of balloons and pink color, however,
            when
            Anna invited William to her hotel after leaving the party, he figured out that Anna already had a boyfriend
            from
            America. Anna apologized to William that she didn’t know her boyfriend would show up. Hopeless and in vain,
            William left the hotel.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            All of William’s friends tried to tell him to move on as Anna is a star and he could find someone better.
            Despite listening to his friends, William couldn’t find anyone to replace Anna in his heart. The sad scene
            was
            moved when Anna finally showed up again at William’s doorstep and told him that she needed some time to stay
            away from camera. William agreed, they again had a good time together. It was not long until Anna left
            William
            again because all the press surrounded William’s flat. William had no choice but to let Anna go again.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Finally, Anna showed up more time at William’s bookstore, giving him a gift and asked him his decision
            again.
            When they were in the middle of the talk, he had a phone from his mother and when he came back, he
            apologized
            and refused to be again with Anna as his mother was having a hard time to remember his name. They once
            again,
            leaving each other.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            William told the stories to all of his friends. All of his friends came to conclusion that he should take a
            chance to win Anna back before she left London. William and his friends raced across the streets and finally
            arrived at the press conference where Anna was there. A lot of reporters were giving Anna questions. William
            had
            a chance to ask her if the man who was taken picture on the newspaper in London where she stayed there shows
            up,
            would she forgive him and be together with him. Anna smiled and said, “Yes, she would.” and she whispered to
            her
            manager who sat next to her something. Her manager then asked one reporter to repeat his question again. The
            reporter asked again, “Anna, how long would you intend to stay here in Britain?” Anna smiled again,
            replying,
            “Indefinitely.” with the smile of William Thacker and everyone in the conference.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Which scenes I like about the film:
            When William recommends Anna about the good travelling books in the beginning of the film. The way he
            demonstrates the book, I believe Hugh Grant should have a 10/10 rating for this scene. It is very natural
            and it
            proves that he knows every book in his bookstore.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>About Hugh Grant:
            When I was young, I watched the film “Music and Lyrics” and when I grew up, I later found out that it was
            Hugh
            Grant who starred the film with Drew Barrymore. The film was released on February 14th, 2007, when I was six
            years old, moving around a lot from Hanoi to Danang city. The two songs I really like from the movies are:
            PoP!
            Goes My Heart and Way Back Into Love. I will include the YouTube links from the two songs.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            About Julia Roberts:
            I just know Julia Roberts when I immigrated to Canada from the song: “It must have been love” from Roxette
            from
            the movie “Pretty Women” where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere were the starring of the film. The movie was
            released on March 23rd, 1990. I haven’t had a chance to watch Pretty Women yet but once I watched it, I will
            definitely write another film review. I will also include the YouTube link for the song: “It must have been
            love” too.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            My rating for the film:
            I would give a 8/10 rating for the film Notting Hill because the film is not very sad and every sad scene is
            moved quickly and the film has a happy ending between the two main characters and all their friends. What I
            really love is the humor of Grant when he can switch topics between asking personal things to Anna and
            talking
            about Horse and Hounds movie which he supposed to talk as an interviewer under the supervision of everyone
            around Anna. And I really love the beauty of Julia Roberts, a charming, beautiful, natural women.

        <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">When Canadians tell us about Vietnamese people</span>
        <br>
        <span class="fs-6 fst-italic">28/03/2019</span>
    </div>
    <div class="mx-5">
        <div>Before reading what I am going to tell you from my CEO class, just put on a headphone and listen to
            this song.
            And
            how do you feel about this song? Is it cool, isn’t it? That was how the guest speakers in my class today
            ended
            the
            presentation of telling their trip to Vietnam, which made me so touched and homesick. How they can
            depict
            rightly
            the picture of Vietnamese life, how they can understand the culture in each places they have been
            through, how
            they
            can clearly state the differences between their country and Vietnam are something that made me feel
            impressive
            and
            admired to these two teachers (also a married couple teacher).
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>Before beginning the classes, when everyone was holding the phone including me, the teacher said: “Put
            the phone
            down and listen to our stories. I’m sure it will not make you disappointed.” He told so firmly and
            determinedly
            that I murmured to myself, “Alright, let’s put the phone back into the pocket and see what interesting
            things
            the teacher is going to show us.” And I still believed that nothing could make me get out of this
            boredom.
            (because the previous class- Canadian History also had guest speaker today so continuing to listen to
            the second
            guest speaker just made me feel bore.) But as soon as he began to introduce the topic today, I was
            really
            surprised and shocked. He was going to tell about Vietnam. And I was like: “I just left Vietnam for 2
            months and
            now I am listening to Canadian talking about Vietnam. Oh! It’s cool. Just begin. I want your perspective
            and
            opinion about Vietnam”.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>And the wife and husband took turn to start slide-showing each picture on the board with the stories in
            each
            one. Each picture emerged, each speech came out, I was totally stun. The more they told, the more I
            admired
            those two people. They told exactly everything in Vietnam: how the house in Vietnam is built, how people
            transit, how people farm, how people go to buy food, … The husband and wife told a lot of stories, two
            of which
            made me laugh so hard. The first one is: “And this woman is like bringing all the business with her. I
            don’t
            know what’s inside of it, maybe it’s “pho”. (He showed the picture of a woman who is on a motorcycle and
            carries
            handcart attached to the motorcycle). The second one is when he told the transportation in Vietnam: “Can
            you
            imagine that we were on the bus and it was red light so we stopped. When we stopped, all the motorcycles
            go
            everywhere around the bus. Then the walker just pass the street. And the interesting here is the walker
            just go
            and all the motorcycle dodge them. And if the walker stops, they will be blaming and shouting on the
            walker:”Hey
            why you are stopping at the middle of road” The two stories made me laugh so hard, even till now.
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>After the class, we- Vietnamese students met the wife and husband. And I could see their admiration in
            how
            friendly and warm-hearted the Vietnamese people are. And the husband and wife really loved the food in
            Vietnam:
            they love pho, which they are still searching for Vietnamese court at here, they love fruit: dragonfly,
            banana,
            especially durian, which they told it was really good, they love springrolls too and fish sauce. That’s
            how I am
            in love with this country, with these people in here. How they think of people first before thinking of
            themselves, how they want to help people with all their hearts. The husband has said: “There is no such
            a place
            as Vietnam that make you want to come back because of their friendliness and hospitality” And the wife
            has said:
            “And the quote I think fully describe my feeling after the trip is “You get a strangle feeling when
            you’re about
            to leave a place. Like you’ll not only miss the people you love but you’ll miss the person you are at
            now at
            this time and this place, because you’ll never be this way ever again.”
