    <i>08/02/2025</i>- Film Review: Notting Hill (1999)
</p>


<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>
        What I do on my holiday break after finishing four courses from my fall 2024 term?
        I chose a random movie to watch. I suddenly thought of the film: The Notting Hill and watched the entire film. I
        both felt likable and unlikable of the film. I will share which scenes make me unlike the film and which scenes
        make me like the film. I will also share some of my knowledge for the main actor and actress in the film: Hugh
        Grant and Julia Roberts. But first, let me take you to the plot of the film. And at the end of my review for the
        film, I will also share my rating for the film.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        The film revolves around a British bookstore owner whose name is William Thacker (starred by Hugh Grant) who is
        deeply in love with a star- Anna Scott (starred by Julia Roberts).
    </li>

    <li>
        Everyday will be the same for the bookstore owner, who also sells book everyday at his bookstore if Anna Scott
        hasn’t stepped in his bookstore. They start the conversation together when he tries to help her the book she
        wants to buy. If you are watching the film, you can tell that William is very interested in Anna as he still
        looked at the door where Anna left, after buying books. After this scene, we will put a question: What will
        happen next? How can they meet again?
    </li>

    <li>
        But not wanting the audience to wait long, the director has let them meet together again when William bought a
        cup of orange juice and accidentally, ran into Anna again, spilling orange juice on her. Then William invited
        Anna to come to his flat, which is nearby, and after she changed clothes, they said goodbye together. But before
        Anna left, Anna kissed William.
    </li>

    <li>
        After that, William asked Spike- who lives in the same flat with William a lot if he received any calls and when
        Spike admitted that he remembered there was one call that William is looking for, William tried to call the
        number and was told to come to the Ritz hotel where Anna would be there. He had to pretend that he was someone
        else to talk with Anna and under the supervision of the people around her, he asked her if she was free tonight,
        unfortunately, Anna said she was busy. Leaving the room with an empty heart, William still had to go through a
        lot of talking with actresses, actors, and directors who also took part with Anna in the film. But finally, when
        he thought he would go back home not achieving anything, he finally got called again, telling him that he had a
        last final room to interview. William, unexpected that the final room would be Anna one more time, went to the
        room tirelessly but the tiresome soon be disappeared when he saw Anna again. She said to William she was free
        tonight.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        Then the party at William’s sister- Honey was organized with the presence of Anna and William. Everyone was
        having a good time. It seems like the movie at the moment is all full of balloons and pink color, however, when
        Anna invited William to her hotel after leaving the party, he figured out that Anna already had a boyfriend from
        America. Anna apologized to William that she didn’t know her boyfriend would show up. Hopeless and in vain,
        William left the hotel.
    </li>

    <li>
        All of William’s friends tried to tell him to move on as Anna is a star and he could find someone better.
        Despite listening to his friends, William couldn’t find anyone to replace Anna in his heart. The sad scene was
        moved when Anna finally showed up again at William’s doorstep and told him that she needed some time to stay
        away from camera. William agreed, they again had a good time together. It was not long until Anna left William
        again because all the press surrounded William’s flat. William had no choice but to let Anna go again.
    </li>

    <li>
        Finally, Anna showed up more time at William’s bookstore, giving him a gift and asked him his decision again.
        When they were in the middle of the talk, he had a phone from his mother and when he came back, he apologized
        and refused to be again with Anna as his mother was having a hard time to remember his name. They once again,
        leaving each other.
    </li>

    <li>
        William told the stories to all of his friends. All of his friends came to conclusion that he should take a
        chance to win Anna back before she left London. William and his friends raced across the streets and finally
        arrived at the press conference where Anna was there. A lot of reporters were giving Anna questions. William had
        a chance to ask her if the man who was taken picture on the newspaper in London where she stayed there shows up,
        would she forgive him and be together with him. Anna smiled and said, “Yes, she would.” and she whispered to her
        manager who sat next to her something. Her manager then asked one reporter to repeat his question again. The
        reporter asked again, “Anna, how long would you intend to stay here in Britain?” Anna smiled again, replying,
        “Indefinitely.” with the smile of William Thacker and everyone in the conference.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        Which scenes I like about the film:
        When William recommends Anna about the good travelling books in the beginning of the film. The way he
        demonstrates the book, I believe Hugh Grant should have a 10/10 rating for this scene. It is very natural and it
        proves that he knows every book in his bookstore.
    </li>

    <li>About Hugh Grant:
        When I was young, I watched the film “Music and Lyrics” and when I grew up, I later found out that it was Hugh
        Grant who starred the film with Drew Barrymore. The film was released on February 14th, 2007, when I was six
        years old, moving around a lot from Hanoi to Danang city. The two songs I really like from the movies are: PoP!
        Goes My Heart and Way Back Into Love. I will include the YouTube links from the two songs.
    </li>

    <li>
        About Julia Roberts:
        I just know Julia Roberts when I immigrated to Canada from the song: “It must have been love” from Roxette from
        the movie “Pretty Women” where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere were the starring of the film. The movie was
        released on March 23rd, 1990. I haven’t had a chance to watch Pretty Women yet but once I watched it, I will
        definitely write another film review. I will also include the YouTube link for the song: “It must have been
        love” too.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        My rating for the film:
        I would give a 8/10 rating for the film Notting Hill because the film is not very sad and every sad scene is
        moved quickly and the film has a happy ending between the two main characters and all their friends. What I
        really love is the humor of Grant when he can switch topics between asking personal things to Anna and talking
        about Horse and Hounds movie which he supposed to talk as an interviewer under the supervision of everyone
        around Anna. And I really love the beauty of Julia Roberts, a charming, beautiful, natural women.

    <i>28/03/2019</i>- When Canadians tell us about Vietnamese people
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

    <li>Before reading what I am going to tell you from my CEO class, just put on a headphone and listen to this song.
        And
        how do you feel about this song? Is it cool, isn’t it? That was how the guest speakers in my class today ended
        the
        presentation of telling their trip to Vietnam, which made me so touched and homesick. How they can depict
        rightly
        the picture of Vietnamese life, how they can understand the culture in each places they have been through, how
        they
        can clearly state the differences between their country and Vietnam are something that made me feel impressive
        and
        admired to these two teachers (also a married couple teacher).
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>Before beginning the classes, when everyone was holding the phone including me, the teacher said: “Put the phone
        down and listen to our stories. I’m sure it will not make you disappointed.” He told so firmly and determinedly
        that I murmured to myself, “Alright, let’s put the phone back into the pocket and see what interesting things
        the teacher is going to show us.” And I still believed that nothing could make me get out of this boredom.
        (because the previous class- Canadian History also had guest speaker today so continuing to listen to the second
        guest speaker just made me feel bore.) But as soon as he began to introduce the topic today, I was really
        surprised and shocked. He was going to tell about Vietnam. And I was like: “I just left Vietnam for 2 months and
        now I am listening to Canadian talking about Vietnam. Oh! It’s cool. Just begin. I want your perspective and
        opinion about Vietnam”.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>And the wife and husband took turn to start slide-showing each picture on the board with the stories in each
        one. Each picture emerged, each speech came out, I was totally stun. The more they told, the more I admired
        those two people. They told exactly everything in Vietnam: how the house in Vietnam is built, how people
        transit, how people farm, how people go to buy food, … The husband and wife told a lot of stories, two of which
        made me laugh so hard. The first one is: “And this woman is like bringing all the business with her. I don’t
        know what’s inside of it, maybe it’s “pho”. (He showed the picture of a woman who is on a motorcycle and carries
        handcart attached to the motorcycle). The second one is when he told the transportation in Vietnam: “Can you
        imagine that we were on the bus and it was red light so we stopped. When we stopped, all the motorcycles go
        everywhere around the bus. Then the walker just pass the street. And the interesting here is the walker just go
        and all the motorcycle dodge them. And if the walker stops, they will be blaming and shouting on the walker:”Hey
        why you are stopping at the middle of road” The two stories made me laugh so hard, even till now.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>After the class, we- Vietnamese students met the wife and husband. And I could see their admiration in how
        friendly and warm-hearted the Vietnamese people are. And the husband and wife really loved the food in Vietnam:
        they love pho, which they are still searching for Vietnamese court at here, they love fruit: dragonfly, banana,
        especially durian, which they told it was really good, they love springrolls too and fish sauce. That’s how I am
        in love with this country, with these people in here. How they think of people first before thinking of
        themselves, how they want to help people with all their hearts. The husband has said: “There is no such a place
        as Vietnam that make you want to come back because of their friendliness and hospitality” And the wife has said:
        “And the quote I think fully describe my feeling after the trip is “You get a strangle feeling when you’re about
        to leave a place. Like you’ll not only miss the people you love but you’ll miss the person you are at now at
        this time and this place, because you’ll never be this way ever again.”
